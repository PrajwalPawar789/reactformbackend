Cybercriminals are always on the prowl, looking for weak links to break and crack. How can users, especially in this increasingly connected world, have complete assurance that their data is safe, wherever it may be located?

Encryption is one of the most common ways to protect sensitive data. Encryption works by taking plain text and converting it into cipher text, which is made up of seemingly random characters. Only those who have the special key can decrypt it. AES uses symmetric key encryption, which involves the use of only one secret key to cipher and decipher information.

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the first and only publicly accessible cipher approved by the US National Security Agency (NSA) for protecting top secret information. AES was first called Rijndael after its two developers, Belgian cryptographers Vincent Rijmen and Joan Daemen.

The following illustration shows how symmetric key encryption works:

lead table (CREATE TABLE leads (
    lead_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    salutation VARCHAR(50),
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    email BYTEA,
    email_status VARCHAR(50),
    job_title VARCHAR(100),
    job_level VARCHAR(50),
    job_function VARCHAR(100),
    job_function_1 VARCHAR(100),
    phone_number BYTEA,
    direct_number VARCHAR(20),
    address_1 VARCHAR(255),
    address_2 VARCHAR(255),
    city VARCHAR(100),
    state VARCHAR(100),
    country VARCHAR(100),
    zip_code VARCHAR(20),
    industry_type VARCHAR(100),
    sub_industry VARCHAR(100),
    employee_size VARCHAR(50),
    sic_code VARCHAR(50),
    naics_code VARCHAR(50),
    revenue_size VARCHAR(50),
    linkedin_link BYTEA,
    domain VARCHAR(255)
);
